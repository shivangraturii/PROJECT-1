1. Rock Paper Scissors



Rock Paper Scissor in C Projects
Description:

Rock Paper Scissor (also known as Stone Paper Scissor) is a classic hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The winner is determined based on simple rules that have made this game a timeless favorite:

Rock vs Paper -> Paper wins (because paper can cover rock).
Rock vs Scissors -> Rock wins (because rock can crush scissors).
Paper vs Scissors -> Scissors wins (because scissors can cut paper).
In this Rock Paper Scissor project, users are asked to make a choice between these three options. The computer will also randomly choose one of the three shapes. Once both the user and the computer have made their choices, the result will be displayed, showing who won the round along with the choices of both players.
